<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>Fun stuff is actually not that fun</p>
<p>1. There's a trade off between the loading time and responding time. to make the program faster to launch, I decided to use database to preload the data and retrieve the data dynamically via runtime.</p>
<p>This approach kind reduces the start up time that the application would need. However, it still takes a long time to load models inside the application.</p>
<p>There is a guy using shader to load the data. That is really awesome. It speeds up the process of generating models and it provides infinity capacity of objects displaying at the same time.</p>
<p>2. For Python, people like how flexible it could be. That's exactly how I feel when I get started. However, there's a really interesting issue I happen to came across.</p>
<p>I have this code working on my PC. And I'm quite happy about that. However, when I run it in the CAVE, something goes wrong and feels really strange. Cause I always question myself. So I keep checking my buggy code trying to find out some problem. It take me 5 hours and I missed the project due.</p>
<p>Turns out to be that on Windows, you are allowed to use a += operator between a None and list. However, on UNIX machine it's not allowed and there will be an error throwing out. Unfortunately, it happens in my slave node instead of my master node so I didn't even notice it until the last minute.</p>
